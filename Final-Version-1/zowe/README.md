## Running the scripts

If you want to try to run the scripts:
- Your system must z/OSMF installed and configured
- You must have a Zowe zosmf Profile created
- You should have that Profile set as the default. If it isn't, you will need to add options to the commands that run.
- All the examples use a TSO ID of Z81187. You need to change all instances of "Z81187" to your TSO ID.
